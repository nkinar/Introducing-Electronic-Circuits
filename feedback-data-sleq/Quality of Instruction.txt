Very passionate, concepts of what is being taught or what students are supposed to take home from the lectures is not always clear
though. Very helpful, however, when it came to assignments and the ahnds on tasks.

Great instructor, passionate about the topics and always finds a way to make them interesting

BEST PROFESSOR EVER will definitely recommend his classes to others. He is patient, helpful and always has the time for us
students. He goes in depth on different theories and has no problem answering any questions we have on the topic if it at first goes
over our heads. Also liked how he brought examples of equipment to class for us to inspect.

Good concise slides, and a good amount of elaboration on the slides from Dr. Kinar.

Nicholas was awesome. Super enthusiastic about us learning the subject he really enjoys himself. He was very good and making
us understand key concepts.

Great. He really cares about his students. He's always available to help. Near the end of the course he went through material a little
faster than I expected, but I understand he's trying to get through material.

Very good instruction.

Great!

Overall the instructor was very knowledgeable and went in depth on a variety of topics
