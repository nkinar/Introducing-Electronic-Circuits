While I am still confused about this class, overall Professor Kinar does a good job with the class. Deliveries could just perhaps use
some work. Really appreciated any help with assignments, as it really contributed to my learning the most.

Great class and very informative.

Only a couple points of criticism:
A bit too much material at the end of the semester. This could have been spaced out better throughout all the lectures.
Would not mind a midterm exam as it is difficult to know what types of questions will come on the final exam.
Would not mind more questions that use some of the formulas introduced in class. Math questions on the final exam is not an
issues either.

I learned a lot in this class really liked the hands on learning. Power points were good aswell

10/10

Very good learning experience, enjoyed this class most of all of my others.

Overall my learning experience was very positive
