This was the best part of the class! Really respected all the effort put into this on Professor Kinar's part. Lots of fun.

Great experience, something new and different to any other classes I have take before

Loved it

I really enjoyed the aspect of being able to use hands on learning with the circuits instead of just learning through presentations.

The calibration of the pyranometer had me a little stumped at first.

I thought it was very helpful and relevant to the concept of models as discussed in the class notes, although I feel like the circuit
building took up so much of the course timeline that it comes at a detriment to the discussions of concepts and theories of
hydrological phenomena.

I thought it was really cool. I never thought about the importance of the construction of an electronic circuit until this class. Shows
how accurate and nonâ€“accurate the devices used to collected field data can be.

It was interesting. I never thought I would be building a circuit within my university journey, but I am happy to have experienced it.

I found it very interesting. As I have never done it before, I found it to be a great learning experience and introduction to circuit
building. I can now say that I have experience with very basic circuit building, which I think is a great skill to have.

very unique activity! I would recommend continuing the activity in upcoming classes, as it is something unlike any other class.

Building the electronic circuits was a very fun learning activity that helped me learn a new skill set. Overall the building of the circuit
took up too much class time but having something that I could take home and use to collect data was great.

It was fun and different. The only thing is it took quite a bit of time away from the class materials.
