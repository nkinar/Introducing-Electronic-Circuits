While I a still confused about it, I think it is good knowledge to know.

I can see better connection between different processes involved in evironal sciences

Environmental sciences are all about systems. Because of this class I think broader now when reviewing a system.

I see systems theory as an integral framework of how we understand natural phenomena in that it is how we can turn readings
from instruments and synthesize them into models that describe a natural system with distinct boundary conditions and specific
inputs.

It's important to understand every component of the environment with great detail. You can use these systems as sub systems to
understand the greater picture.

very important

Understanding systems and the theory behind how they work is important to understanding the natural environment for a variety of
environmental studies.

I never thought about the importance of these systems before this class, so I suppose it opened my eyes to the complexity of
research
