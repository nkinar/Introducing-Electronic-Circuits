I learnt that its a lot more difficult than it seems and what people say.

Models are helpful in predicting the hydrological process but there are always some assumptions to be made and one can not
100% rely on a model

I did find the models a bit challenging as it was a different type of thinking. It definitely made me think outside the box about all the
different variables contributing to the system as a whole and to individual parts of the system.

Important to know that much of what we think we know about hydrological phenomena, especially on a largeâ€“scale, are based on
models that have inherent assumptions that makes it function, which introduces error or inaccuracies. These uncertainties are
inevitable, but

I teaches you how to come to your own conclusions and back up your conclusion with knowledgable statements.

I learned how to delve deeper into specific thought processes. How to check a model and compare it to quantitative data that was
collected, and how much assumptions affect things.

The class involved a lot of critical thinking with regards to hydrological processes.
