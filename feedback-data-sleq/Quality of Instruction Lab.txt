There was not really any lab sections for this class but when building the circuit he was very good.

Great instructor, passionate about the topics and always finds a way to make them interesting

Great job

Wonderful support if we messed up our circuit pieces instead of saying "uh oh sorry cant help you with that guess your gonna get a
zero" he was willing to go the extra mile and take time out of his busy schedule to repair the circuits that had technical issues. He
even took videos to show us so we would know how to repair them in the future if we needed.

Very well–organized and well–supplied circuit–building sessions. Assistance from Dr. Kinar was indispensable. Having the circuit
kits be in individual ziplock bags with clearly demarcated parts greatly improved the efficiency of the building process.
It was cool having multiple guest lecturers. It showed us different aspects of the field of hydrology. Nicholas would go out of his way
to help students out.

He was very helpful and is very passionate about what he teaches. One of the best instructors I have ever had. I really appreciate his
passion and how much he cares about our actual learning in this class.

Great!

The labs were very hands on and helped my learning a lot.

Nick was very nice, accessible, and understanding. I have no bad things to say about his class.
