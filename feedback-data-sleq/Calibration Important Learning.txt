Yes, I do if you are wanting to do a degree in hydrology or a minor in water science. It is something that could be applied after
university.

Yes, it is a useful skill to have when doing research or applying for jobs.

Yes as they are useful in future research

Yes I do, as scientists we should know how to do field and lab exercises and how to calibrate, maintain and use our own machines.
Yes, I thought they were very helpful at giving a scaled down conceptualization of how scientific models work. Seeing the nonsense
uncalibrated data from the T/RH and pyranometers and figuring out the calibration coefficient using highâ€“school math was helpful
in understanding how theory must be applied to instruments.

Yes they are. It teaches you how you can create your own model and the accuracy of the model.

Sure. Before this class I did not think so because I did not know. Now that I have learnt more about it, I would say its important.

Yes I do think so because environmental scientists use many electronic instruments involving circuits to measure certain
hydrological processes. I think it is a good skill to have if you can know how the circuits themselves work and maybe even be able to
develop your own basic instruments.

Yes. Because those are things we should have a good understanding of if we plan on doing research work. We need to know how
to troubleshoot, or what may be going wrong, or what things we should be considering. Circuits are a good use for analog models,
and it is definitely important to be familiar with them.

Instrument calibration is very important to environmental scientists because it ensures accurate data collection.
