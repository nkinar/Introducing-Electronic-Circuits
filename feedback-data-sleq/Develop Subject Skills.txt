The circuit activity was great. i feel like assignments could maybe be made a little more clear. More specifically questions like
question 2 in assignment 3 were not always clear on what was wanted in the submissions in terms of data.

Circuit building – building temperature, relative humidity and pyranometer sensor and calibrating them.
using knowledge to structure our own model

use knowledge to structure own formulation of question

Every assignment would allow us to demonstrate our understanding of the subject.

I had to develop more critical thinking skills as the assignments didn't really have any exact right answer; it was up to a lot of our
own personal circuit building, "story telling" with mathematical equations, building and organizing models, systems and subsystems.

there were many opportunities to demonstrate my knowledge on the multiple assignments
