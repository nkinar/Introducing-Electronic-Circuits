The circuit activity is a fun, educational, and hands-on way,
of breaking up the class.  It keeps students interested and 
gave them something they can take home and show for their work
in the course.  I also found that it encouraged attendance of the class.
Professor Kinar, clearly a lot of work was put in on your behalf and 
explainations were very clear for the most part.  Thank you!
