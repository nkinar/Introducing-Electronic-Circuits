The circuit activity was a very unique and beneficial experience!  I have not had the opportunity
to do something such as this in my previous studies, & I'm thankful for all the time Professor
Kinar put into building these kits for us.  Learning about the process used to build circuits,
even unrelated to hydrological processes, has been a great learning experience!
